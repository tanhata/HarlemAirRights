## Abstract  
This project proposes a framework for leveraging air rights in Harlem to develop affordable housing, focusing on equitable economic empowerment for the community. The methodology integrates a novel financial model, a computational analysis of urban datasets, and an algorithmic design strategy to optimize the development process. Our approach addresses the challenges of housing affordability while preserving Harlem's cultural and architectural integrity.

## Key Components  

### 1. **BitLot: A Community Corporation**  
#### Objectives:  
- **Aggregate Air Rights:** Develop a system for acquiring and consolidating air rights within Harlem.  
- **Community Wealth Building:** Enable long-term residents and those with generational ties to Harlem to invest in development projects.  

#### Implementation:  
- **Policy Adaptation:** Advocate for NYC Department of City Planning to waive existing air rights transfer restrictions in Harlem.  
- **Capital Formation:**  
  - **Community Capital:** Initiate crowdfunding and asset pooling mechanisms for residents.  
  - **External Funding:** Supplement development costs through federal tax credits, municipal subsidies, and socially responsible investment vehicles.  
- **Revenue Model:** Reduce operational costs through tax exemptions and redistribute operating revenue as dividends to community investors.

### 2. **AirLot: Algorithmic Structural Design Strategy**  
#### Objectives:  
- **Automated Design:** Create a computational framework to rapidly generate contextually appropriate building designs based on zoning and community-defined constraints.  
- **Cost Efficiency:** Reduce construction costs through parametric modeling and modular building systems.  

#### Implementation:  
- **Design Parameters:** Utilize community-defined inputs (e.g., density, typology, cultural preferences) to algorithmically generate building configurations.  
- **Optimization:** Leverage structural heuristics and zoning datasets to identify optimal buildable airspace and minimize material usage.

## Data Analysis and Computational Framework  
The project employs Python-based libraries and tools to process, analyze, and visualize datasets related to zoning, demographics, energy usage, and urban morphology:  

- **`pandas`**: Data manipulation and aggregation.  
- **`geopandas`**: Geospatial analysis of zoning and parcel data.  
- **`numpy`**: Numerical computations and matrix operations.  
- **`matplotlib`**: Visualization of spatial and statistical data.

## Technical Workflow  

1. **Dataset Preparation:**  
   - Extract and clean zoning and building datasets from public sources such as NYC Open Data.  
   - Process demographic and energy usage data to establish correlations between community needs and zoning opportunities.  

2. **Air Rights Mapping:**  
   - Develop geospatial models to identify transferable air rights and their potential aggregation.  
   - Generate heatmaps to visualize areas with the highest development potential.  

3. **Structural Design Generation:**  
   - Employ parametric design tools to generate modular building layouts optimized for airspace utilization.  
   - Simulate construction and material costs to refine project feasibility.  

4. **Economic Modeling:**  
   - Build financial projections for BitLot projects, incorporating tax exemptions, community investment, and operational costs.  
   - Quantify community dividends based on various funding scenarios.

## Key Outcomes  
- **Unlock Development Potential:** Identify and utilize millions of square feet of unused airspace.  
- **Promote Ownership:** Ensure long-term Harlem residents retain ownership in new developments.  
- **Increase Efficiency:** Reduce development costs through modular construction strategies.  
- **Enhance Resilience:** Design housing projects aligned with community-defined values and Harlemâ€™s historical character.
